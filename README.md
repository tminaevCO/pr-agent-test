### Watching for Changes

- **`npm run watch:tailwind`**  
  Watches for changes in TailwindCSS files and re-compiles them on-the-fly.

## Best Practices

This section outlines the essential guidelines and templates for working with the theme, including styling rules, JavaScript components, and Liquid section creation.

### Styling Guidelines

Follow these rules for writing styles to maintain consistency and scalability:

1. **Using TailwindCSS classes**  
   - Write TailwindCSS classes directly in the Liquid files as `class` attributes.  
     Example: `<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4"></div>`  

2. **Custom TailwindCSS classes**  
   - If a custom class is needed, define it in `src/styles/main.css`. TailwindCSS features like `@apply`, mixins, and breakpoints can be used here.  
     Example:
     ```css
     .custom-button {
       @apply bg-blue-500 text-white rounded p-2;
     }
     ```

3. **Pure CSS or SCSS for advanced customization**  
   - For styles that cannot or should not use TailwindCSS, write pure CSS or SCSS in a separate file located in the `src/styles/` folder. TailwindCSS utilities will not work here.  
     Example:
     ```scss
     .custom-container {
       display: flex;
       justify-content: center;
       align-items: center;
       background-color: #333;
       color: #fff;
     }
     ```

---

### JavaScript Component Template

Use this basic template for creating reusable web components:

```javascript
if (!customElements.get('my-element')) {
  class MyElement extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
      super();
      this.state = {};
      this.selectors = {};
      this.elements = {};
      this.modificators = {};
    }

    connectedCallback() {
      // Code to run when the element is added to the DOM
    }

    disconnectedCallback() {
      // Code to run when the element is removed from the DOM
    }
  }

  customElements.define('my-element', MyElement);
}
```
### Liquid Section Best Practices

Use this template for creating sections:

```liquid
{% liquid
  assign value = section.settings.value
  assign value_second = section.settings.value_second
%}

<div class="">
  <!-- Section content -->
</div>

{% schema %}
{
    "name": "Section Name",
    "class": "section-class",
    "tag": "section",
    "settings": [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "id": "value",
            "label": "Value"
        },
        {
            "type": "text",
            "id": "value_second",
            "label": "Second Value"
        }
    ],
    "blocks": [
        {
            "type": "default",
            "name": "Default Block"
        }
    ],
    "presets": [
        {
            "name": "Default Preset",
            "category": "Category",
            "blocks": []
        }
    ]
}
{% endschema %}
```

## File Rules

Follow these rules for working with specific files to ensure proper functionality, maintainability, and optimization of the theme.

### `theme.liquid`

- **Wrap all content in `{%- capture layout_content -%}`**  
  This ensures that the page's content is captured as a text object (`layout_content`). The captured content can then be passed to snippets or scripts for processing.  
  Example:
  ```liquid
  {%- capture layout_content -%}
    <!-- Page content goes here -->
  {%- endcapture -%}
  ```

### `theme-styles.liquid` 

- **(in the <head> of the page)**  
  This file is used to include styles dynamically. The layout_content object is passed here to check for the existence of specific tags, classes, or web components, ensuring only necessary styles are loaded.
  Example:
  ```liquid
  {% if layout_content contains 'my-component' %}
    /* Include styles for 'my-component' */
  {% endif %}
  ```

### `theme-scripts.liquid` 

- **(at the end of the <body>)**  
  This file is used to include scripts dynamically. The layout_content object is passed to perform checks and include only the necessary scripts.
  Example:
  ```liquid
  {% if layout_content contains 'my-component' %}
    /* Include scripts for 'my-component' */
  {% endif %}
  ```
